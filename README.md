# Java_JSP
JSP technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology. It can be thought of as an extension to Servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language, JSTL, etc. Here student marks system has been developed with the knowledge of java server pages technology. We can perform CRUD operations of student marks stored in the databse.
The app name is Student Marks System(SMS) App. Here,  we can add any student, his/her marks, roll number and name. All the details get saved in the database for which we have used MySQL.
